      Executes a jq query on a provided JSON input to extract specific data. The script processes a JSON object, mapping the value of 'b' within the nested object keyed by '10' to a new object keyed by the 'id' value. This demonstrates how to use jq to transform and query JSON data efficiently.
    executor: jq
    command: '{(.id): .["10"].b}'

      {"id": "sample", "10": {"b": 42}}
