steps:
  - name: pass 'hello'
    description: |
      Executes an echo command to output the string 'hello'. The output of this command is captured in a variable named OUT1 for use in subsequent steps.
    command: echo hello
    output: OUT1
  - name: output 'hello world'
    description: |
      Utilizes bash to concatenate the previously stored 'hello' string with 'world', effectively creating the output 'hello world'. This demonstrates how to pass output between steps in a sequence, relying on the completion of the 'pass \'hello\'' step.
    command: bash
    script: |
      echo $OUT1 world
    depends:
      - pass 'hello'
