      Initiates the workflow by echoing 'start'. This serves as a preliminary step for other actions that depend on its completion.
    command: echo start
  - name: foo
    description: |
      Echoes 'foo' contingent on the 'step1' completion and the condition that the first argument ('$1') is 'foo'. This step demonstrates conditional execution based on argument values.
    command: echo foo
    depends:
      - step1
    preconditions:
      - condition: "$1"
        expected: foo
  - name: bar

      Similar to the 'foo' step, this echoes 'bar' provided 'step1' has completed and the first argument ('$1') is 'bar'. It's another instance of executing actions based on specified conditions.
    command: echo bar
    depends:
      - step1
    preconditions:
      - condition: "$1"
        expected: bar
  - name: bar2
    description: |
      This step echoes 'bar' again but depends solely on the completion of the 'bar' step. It shows how actions can be sequentially chained through dependencies.
    command: echo bar
    depends:
      - bar
